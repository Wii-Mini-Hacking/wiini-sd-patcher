# Wii mini SD Patcher

Tool to aid in the installation of required software for restoring SD functionality on the Wii mini, based on [Aurelio's RVLoader Installer](https://github.com/Aurelio92/RVLoader/tree/main/installer)

Most of the code was written and documented by Aurelio for RVLoader, without whose help this project would not have been possible.
Priiloader code and binaries (priiloader.c/h/app) originally by DacoTaco for [Priiloader](https://github.com/DacoTaco/priiloader)

For information and assistance on how to use this software, please visit [the Wii mini Hacking Discord server](https://discord.gg/7jNHphfDQk)

Features:

- Patch and install original Wii IOS (versions 36, 58 and 80):
	
	These "nowifi" patches allow the IOSes to work without the need for a Wireless network card, while keeping the SD modules that are not present on the Wii mini IOS, thus allowing for a soldered SD card to work almost fully on a Wii mini console.
- Install the Wii System Menu and Priiloader
	This just simplifies the installation of the System Menu WAD if present on the USB drive, while providing some safety if it fails by instantly installing Priiloader on top of it.
- Install the Open Homebrew Channel as LULZ to replace upside-down hbc (TBA)
