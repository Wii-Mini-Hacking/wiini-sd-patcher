# Wii mini SD Patcher

Tool to aid in the installation of required software for restoring SD functionality on the Wii mini, based on [Aurelio's RVLoader Installer](https://github.com/Aurelio92/RVLoader/tree/main/installer)

Most of the code was written and documented by Aurelio for RVLoader, without whose help this project would not have been possible.

Features:

- Patch and install original Wii IOS (versions 36, 58 and 80):
	
	These "nowifi" patches allow the IOSes to work without the need of a Wireless network card, while keeping the SD modules that are not present on the Wii mini IOS, thus allowing for a soldered SD card to work almost fully on a Wii mini console.
- Load and install The Wii System Menu and the Open Homebrew Channel (Coming Soon)

	This will only simplify the Installation of these WADs if present on the USB drive, as it can still be installed with any other WAD manager but still requires them to be manually obtained from NUS and the OHBC GitHub
